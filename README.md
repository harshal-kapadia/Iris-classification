# Iris-classification

This is the most basic implementation of Machine Learning algorithms. The data set is about the flowers and 3 different species and the different algorithms classify them. The algorithms used are K nearest neighbors, Decision tree classifier, Support vector machines, Logistic regression.

The dataset contains different parameters of the flowers of different species. 
The parameters are 
-petal length
-petal width
-sepal length
-sepal width

The species are of 3 types :-
i. Iris-setosa
ii. Iris-versicolor
iii. Iris-virginica

The performance of different classifier algorithms is checked on this data.
Decision Tree has a good accuracy but it is lower than KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
